# Fusion360-Scripts
Modifying code from various forums to produce programmatic curves in Fusion 360 for 3D printing or laser cutting.

## [GenerateArchimedesSpiral](https://github.com/MrHuman22/Fusion360-Scripts/blob/master/GenerateArchimedesSpiralPoints.py)
* Creates a new sketch on the XY i.e. top plane containing an archimedes spiral of numTurns using a fitted spline from pointsPerTurn from an offset and a gap of distanceBetweenTurns

## [GenerateLogarithmicSpiralPoints](https://github.com/MrHuman22/Fusion360-Scripts/blob/master/GenerateLogarithmicSpiralPoints.py)
* Adapted from GenerateArchimedesSpiral
* Creates a new sketch on the XY i.e top plane containing a logarithmic spiral with variables *a* (direction and overall size) and *b* (tightness of the spiral) using a fitted spline from pointsPerTurn from an offset
